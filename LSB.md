title: Low Surface Brightness Imaging
---

I completed my Master of Physics (Astrophysics) in 2017 at The University of Western Australia working on the StarFox telescope under the supervision of Dr. Aaron Robotham. The StarFox telescope is part of a revival of the study of the low surfacebrightness universe using smaller, cheaper refracting telescopes. This revival has lead to an increased interest in diffuse structures surrounding bright galaxies that are thought to trace the remnants of our current 'hierarchical' model of galaxy formation and large, diffuse dwarf galaxies dubbed 'Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies' amongst other things. I am therefore highly interested in using the low surface brightness universe to study galaxy formation and in attempting to better understand the differences between the populations of 'concentrated' and 'diffuse' things in the Universe.

## Masters Thesis Abstract:

Recent advances in optical technology have heralded the return of the original, refracting, telescope design. Able to minimise scattered light in the optical train and curtailing aperture obstructions refracting telescopes have become the weapon of choice in the astronomers' arsenal for low surface brightness imaging of the universe. Relatively inexpensive, small refracting telescopes have become highly accessible and hence the International Center for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR) has funded their own small refractor, StarFox. In this thesis we describe the commissioning run of StarFox, outlining our observational strategies together with the customised data reduction pipeline we have built for StarFox. Our primary goal is to create a system whereby we can stack ultra-long, ~ 50 hour, integrations continuing to increase signal to noise as $\sqrt{N}$ for N images stacked to allow low surface brightness imaging. On the back of this we have a secondary science goal of being able to provide optical counterpart imaging to the low HI column density survey IMAGINE. Happily, we are able to report we have achieved this primary goal and have created co-added stacks targeting NGC 2997 totaling 42.25, 41.75, 44.83 hours on source achieving pixel surface brightness depths of 26.5, 26.1 and 26.25 mag arcsec<sup>-2<\sup> in each of the Sloan g, r and i filter bands. Remarkably this depth of imaging is comparable to that of the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey but was taken using a telescope worth orders of magnitude less capital, on a non dark sky site.
